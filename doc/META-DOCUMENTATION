META-DOCUMENTATION - documentation about the documentation

We use yodl, an excellent text processing tool, to produce manual pages
and html.  Pre-generated files are, of course, included.  If you want
to work on the documentation, you'll need yodl:

A note about style:

This documentation is intended to be 100% complete.  Every behaviour
should be documented, so the user should never have to experiment to
find out how something works.  Strange X11-isms (like transient
windows) should be explained both in and of themselves and with
reference to MacOS or Windows if appropriate.

The intended audience is intelligent but inexperienced with X11/unix.
I like to think of the intended audience as a neurosurgeon or a
mathematician - the audience is smarter than I am, so we don't "talk
down" to them, but they don't have the time or motivation to delve into
X/unix documentation, so we strive for brevity and completeness at the
same time.
