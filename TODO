- motif hints override is!

- ignore all BadWindow errors, simpler error handler (remove error.[hc])
- enable unbinding of keys and buttons
- send synthetic event if needed on ConfigureRequest (ICCCM 4.1.5)
- click-to-focus
- AlwaysOnTop, AlwaysOnBottom
- no need to raise window on workspace change?
- omnipresent windows - need to make focus rings external lists
- NoFocus input focus policy
- ignore all restacking requests
- removable titlebar
- detect TRANSIENT_FOR cycles
- transient for root means something special?
- use autoconf
- test with XFree86 3.3 and 4.0
- config file
- shaped windows with titlebar
- check for strerror in configure.in
- supply bogus snprintf and strerror if none available
- test on SunOS 4.x with old Sun X server
- key- and mouse-bindings to config file
- remove semicolon from end of context markers
- rename MoveToWorkspace to SendToWorkspace
- always_on_{top|bottom} to config file
- pass_focus_click to config file
- AltTabBehaviour = { Skip, RaiseImmediately, RaiseOnCycleFinish, DontRaise }
- colors to config file
- line numbers in error messages of parser.y are off
- motif hints, looks simple enough
- close .xwmrc fd
- name the workspaces "Workspace %d", ewmh
- variable number of workspaces to config file
- framework for global options (nworkspaces)
- differentiate between hint-based, user-based, and overridden options
- on resize to move, don't allow mouse to be outside window
- maximize vertical, horizontal
- clean up the AltTab() crap, see .xwmrc for ideas
- function composition
- options DontBindKeys, DontBindMouse (boolean)
- sticky windows: don't bind move/resize actions
- allow window titles to be centered and right-aligned
- old gnome hints, much like EWMH 1.1 (look at xmms)
- remove ewmh rants from code
- option WorkspaceSendTransients (boolean)
- use stacking_desktop_{window|frame} for EWMH
- manage client on first maprequest, not window creation
- on alt tab, perceptible delay between titlebar color change and raise
- colormaps
- change window according to prefs when changes ws, becomes shaped, etc.
- user-settable font, global option
- titlebar height depends on font height or user pref, experiment
- set workspace_current from _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP, for restarting
- remove titlebars on normal exit, for restarting
- save focus stacks in some property for restarting
- proxy clicks for GNOME
- ask about KEEP_ON_TOP WM_STATE
- deal with autoconf problems on Debian and Solaris
- xwm -> ahwm
- raise delay, need better timer handler
- handle SEGV, BUS
- 'make install' should work and 'make clean' shouldn't remove parser.c
- zombies on FreeBSD
- timestamp focus issue
- on first start, pop up dialog explaining what's going on
- documentation to cvs
- default-message.h to cvs
- window placement wrt. old titlebars on restart, use X property
- implement MoveResize()
- start xwm from an xterm, that xterm doesn't get _NET_DESKTOP prop
- use WM_MACHINE_NAME, _NET_WM_PID for killing windows
- option to turn off _NET_WM_PID stuff, protocol not used by default
- BindButton -> BindClick
- real timers: needed for ping, shading animation
- double-click action

Abandoned, no longer TODO:
- "stop" focus, detect when pointer stops in a window (no timeout) -
  impossible using motion events, perhaps possible with
  XGetDeviceMotionEvents, but that's not supported by all X servers
- play with gradients - X imaging model kind of sucks; only way to do it
  would be to make my own graphics abstraction API which gives a straight
  RGB array and then go in a tight loop doing XPutPixel() whenever
  gradient updated, in addition to dealing with all of the visual types
  and bit depths by hand.  Not worth it my time programming it or my
  computer's time doing it whenever I resize a window.
- perhaps avoid transient windows on alt-tab? - don't like it that way
- ungrab mouse, keyboard on unmapped clients - point being?
- deal with old border width in places ICCCM requires it - already doing it
- use automake? - don't see the point, doesn't help me in any way
- have a "reset" function that resets colormap installation as per
  ICCCM 2.0 - restart has same effect

BUG - badwindow on XSetInputFocus, deleting one window kills a sibling which
was to be the next focused window.  Easiest to ignore this error and other
similar non-fatal errors brought upon by race conditions. - FIXED

BUG - still have free() bug in move-resize.c; perhaps start using my
memory allocation auditing routines. - FIXED

BUG - open konqueror, open file->open location, focus other window, refocus
konqueror - does some crazy resizing, perhaps reading wrong gravity hint - FIXED

BUG - Resize window, while resizing, switch workspaces, switch back,
drafting lines and geometry display are screwed up. - FIXED

BUG - have gravity in two places: XSizeHints and XWindowAttributes;
seems that gravity in XWindowAttributes is completely ignored in most
window managers, just like in mine.  Need to test this.  FIXED - doesn't
cause problems, leaving it as is

BUG - when moving GTK window after window initially mapped, application
has wrong idea of window's size - test by using the gimp's tool options
window - FIXED

BUG - 'xterm -sb' segfaults - FIXED

BUG - resizing shaped windows, leaves remnants on top lines - FIXED

BUG - setting mouse function for button release doesn't work - FIXED

BUG - resize a window with some other window in the background.  If
window in background is continually updating contents, resize graphics
messed up somehow.  WindowMaker somehow disables other windows from
updating while resizing, but that seems a bit too much. - FIXED
it seems that wmaker and enlightenment grab the server when they move a
window, which I am definitely NOT doing.  Leaving as is.

BUG - seems to be spending a lot of time in event_get(), but not system
time, user time.  Something I don't know about select()? - FIXED

BUG - resize oclock to 0 by 0 and accept; keyboard resize no longer
works - FIXED, see below bug

BUG - when move/resize initiated via keyboard, uses what's under mouse,
not what has focus - FIXED

BUG - many times when right-click titlebar to maximize window, mouse
grabbed and then not let go.  Only happens on FreeBSD machine for
some reason - FIXED, problem with timestamp to XGrabPointer.

BUG - sometimes on alt-tab, focus reverts to PointerRoot, log saved in
alt-tab-bug.errs, can't reproduce - FIXED: haven't seen this after months of
usage; probably inadvertently fixed at some point

BUG - middle-click to close some window, click sometimes gets passed to next
window, pasting stuff - FIXED: this will always happen when killing window
on ButtonPress, doesn't happen when killing on ButtonRelease

BUG - when switching to a workspace which has no windows, no longer
getting keyboard events - FIXED: all the key-handling stuff depends on the
'revert_to' window in focus.c.

BUG - when switching to a workspace which has transients in it,
getting multiple EnterNotify events for the transients, causes input focus
to jump about wildly for a bit of time - FIXED: haven't observed in months

BUG - resize xterm off-screen using "echo -ne '\033[8;120;120t'" - resize
code no longer seems to honor client's height/width increment hints.
Looks like xterm bug off-hand, need to check - FIXED: problem seems
gone on recent builds

BUG - run xload or xeyes, they don't take keyboard input, doesn't bind
keys - FIXED

BUG - sometimes when xterm loses focus, it doesn't update its cursor; looks
like an xterm bug, other window managers do same thing - FIXED:  definitely
xterm bug

BUG - strange interaction in window moving edge-resistance, sometimes
pointer leaves window when moving quickly, can't reproduce

BUG - xmms playlist resize doesn't work, ahwm constrains
