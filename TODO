TODO before release:
- run autoscan again
- implement MoveResize()
- resize and restart bound to same key
- placement, use corner with least overlap first
- _NET_WORKAREA and STRUT
- keep _WM_STATE, _WIN_LAYER updated
- implement "ping" protocol
- transient for self means something?  Directory property window in konq
- figure out what the hell 'sticky' means to EWMH
- start xwm from an xterm, that xterm doesn't get _NET_DESKTOP prop
- test with a modern version of Sun's X implementation
- test final build with various options at least two weeks before initial release

Wishlist:
- 'is!' overrides '=', even if '=' comes later
- GotoNextWorkspace(integer)
- CycleNextWorkspaces() (like AltTab())
- no need to grab buttons for titlebar binds, just listen for events
- bindings in contexts
- shading, perhaps with an optional animation
- may need fake client struct for revert_to window for dynamic bindings
- contact author of 'kpager', figure out what the problem is
- allow binding to click and drag on same place
- use XInternAtoms for ewmh.c
- 'mouse' map_policy placement algorithm - map window under mouse
- finish support for DontRaise for CycleBehaviour
- for focus click, grab all combinations of click and modifier?
- cascade placement algorithm
- deal with window "strut"
- placement algos to config file
- 2-bit struct fields not portable, use autoconf
- grab pointer on MOUSE_DEPRESS, ungrab when receive ButtonRelease?
- session management (WM_SAVE_YOURSELF, WM_CLIENT_LEADER, etc.)
- old KDE 1.1 hints?
- we assume that focused window is somehow raised (eg, on window cycling)
- window edge resistance
- screen edge resistance on resize
- double-click action
- send MB4 and MB5 "clicks" to focus window when received on root
- remove any R6isms
- compress ConfigureRequest events, and others if possible
- buttons on titlebars
- optional window sizing frame?
- gui frontend for .ahwmrc
- window positions persist across sessions
- add saveunder option (where would I use this?)
- keep bottom 1 pixel free of windows, bind menu there (separate program?)
- profile, optimize, create benchmarks

Finished, no longer TODO:
- titlebar subwindow
- mouse interface similar to keyboard interface
- delete windows
- window gravity in configure events
- clients always have frames, but maybe not titlebars
- maximization
- allow shift+j to shove window to bottom edge of screen during move
- ICCCM input focus models
- shape extension
- window groups
- reset client's border width to zero and keep around old border width
- experiment with motion event compression - XPutBackEvent
- transient windows, keep on top of client but maybe not focused
- workspaces, experiment with both implementation methods
- ensure we revert to previous focus window when window unmapped
- colored workspaces
- need to ignore EnterNotify in certain places, calculate if it will
  happen, then wait for it
- figure out why xterm doesn't change cursor when loses focus sometimes
- specify ICCCM 2.0 compliance
- use standard cursors (XC_bottom_right_corner)

- screen edge resistance
- reparent window on first MapRequest, not CreateNotify (workaround xterm bug)
- use save sets
- UTF-8_STRING is actually UTF8_STRING, typo in EWMH 1.1
- have a "quote" function that sends following key event to client
  also change background to white when quoting
  also make it work for mouse clicks as well as keystrokes
- combine mouse.c, keyboard.c into keyboard-mouse.c
- window placement algorithms
- clean up keyboard-mouse.c
- when switching workspaces, can see unmapping - better unmap from bottom up
- reap children
- hold down alt, hit tab, hit 2, should get out of alt_tab
- ignore all BadWindow errors, simpler error handler (remove error.[hc])
- enable unbinding of keys and buttons
- send synthetic event if needed on ConfigureRequest (ICCCM 4.1.5)
- click-to-focus

- maximize vertical, horizontal
- clean up the AltTab() crap, see .xwmrc for ideas
- function composition
- options DontBindKeys, DontBindMouse (boolean)
- sticky windows: don't bind move/resize actions

- save focus stacks in some property for restarting
- proxy clicks for GNOME
- ask about KEEP_ON_TOP WM_STATE

- zombies on FreeBSD
- timestamp focus issue
- on first start, pop up dialog explaining what's going on
- documentation to cvs
- default-message.h to cvs
- window placement wrt. old titlebars on restart, use X property

Abandoned, no longer TODO:
- "stop" focus, detect when pointer stops in a window (no timeout) -
  impossible using motion events, perhaps possible with
  XGetDeviceMotionEvents, but that's not supported by all X servers
- play with gradients - X imaging model kind of sucks; only way to do it
  would be to make my own graphics abstraction API which gives a straight
  RGB array and then go in a tight loop doing XPutPixel() whenever
  gradient updated, in addition to dealing with all of the visual types
  and bit depths by hand.  Not worth it my time programming it or my
  computer's time doing it whenever I resize a window.
- perhaps avoid transient windows on alt-tab? - don't like it that way
- ungrab mouse, keyboard on unmapped clients - point being?
- deal with old border width in places ICCCM requires it - already doing it
- use automake? - don't see the point, doesn't help me in any way
- have a "reset" function that resets colormap installation as per
  ICCCM 2.0 - restart has same effect

BUG - badwindow on XSetInputFocus, deleting one window kills a sibling which
was to be the next focused window.  Easiest to ignore this error and other
similar non-fatal errors brought upon by race conditions. - FIXED

BUG - still have free() bug in move-resize.c; perhaps start using my
memory allocation auditing routines. - FIXED

BUG - open konqueror, open file->open location, focus other window, refocus
konqueror - does some crazy resizing, perhaps reading wrong gravity hint - FIXED

BUG - Resize window, while resizing, switch workspaces, switch back,
drafting lines and geometry display are screwed up. - FIXED

BUG - have gravity in two places: XSizeHints and XWindowAttributes;
seems that gravity in XWindowAttributes is completely ignored in most
window managers, just like in mine.  Need to test this.  FIXED - doesn't
cause problems, leaving it as is

BUG - when moving GTK window after window initially mapped, application
has wrong idea of window's size - test by using the gimp's tool options
window - FIXED

BUG - 'xterm -sb' segfaults - FIXED

BUG - resizing shaped windows, leaves remnants on top lines - FIXED

BUG - setting mouse function for button release doesn't work - FIXED

BUG - resize a window with some other window in the background.  If
window in background is continually updating contents, resize graphics
messed up somehow.  WindowMaker somehow disables other windows from
updating while resizing, but that seems a bit too much. - FIXED
it seems that wmaker and enlightenment grab the server when they move a
window, which I am definitely NOT doing.  Leaving as is.

BUG - seems to be spending a lot of time in event_get(), but not system
time, user time.  Something I don't know about select()? - FIXED

BUG - resize oclock to 0 by 0 and accept; keyboard resize no longer
works - FIXED, see below bug

BUG - when move/resize initiated via keyboard, uses what's under mouse,
not what has focus - FIXED

BUG - many times when right-click titlebar to maximize window, mouse
grabbed and then not let go.  Only happens on FreeBSD machine for
some reason - FIXED, problem with timestamp to XGrabPointer.

BUG - sometimes on alt-tab, focus reverts to PointerRoot, log saved in
alt-tab-bug.errs, can't reproduce - FIXED: haven't seen this after months of
usage; probably inadvertently fixed at some point

BUG - middle-click to close some window, click sometimes gets passed to next
window, pasting stuff - FIXED: this will always happen when killing window
on ButtonPress, doesn't happen when killing on ButtonRelease

BUG - when switching to a workspace which has no windows, no longer
getting keyboard events - FIXED: all the key-handling stuff depends on the
'revert_to' window in focus.c.

BUG - when switching to a workspace which has transients in it,
getting multiple EnterNotify events for the transients, causes input focus
to jump about wildly for a bit of time - FIXED: haven't observed in months

BUG - resize xterm off-screen using "echo -ne '\033[8;120;120t'" - resize
code no longer seems to honor client's height/width increment hints.
Looks like xterm bug off-hand, need to check - FIXED: problem seems
gone on recent builds

BUG - run xload or xeyes, they don't take keyboard input, doesn't bind
keys - FIXED

BUG - sometimes when xterm loses focus, it doesn't update its cursor; looks
like an xterm bug, other window managers do same thing - FIXED:  definitely
xterm bug

BUG - strange interaction in window moving edge-resistance, sometimes
pointer leaves window when moving quickly, can't reproduce
